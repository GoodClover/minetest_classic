While the code of the `default` mod was written from scratch it often follows the
original C++ code closely, so out of caution **LGPLv2.1 (or later)** was chosen as license.
Most media files were directly copied from Minetest-c55 0.3.1 which is **CC BY-SA 3.0**.

For details please check the LICENSE.txt files in individual mods, notably [default](mods/default/LICENSE.txt).
