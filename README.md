# Minetest Classic

This game is a recreation of the classic Minetest-c55 0.3 gameplay, including:
* Original textures
* All four mobs
* Identical items, crafting recipes, dig times; closely matched ore distribution

Unlike the original it has (optional) support for:
* Sounds
* PvP
* Engine features such as the modern skybox (*TBD*), waving or shadows
* Modern creative inventory and per-player creative mode

This is a game for the [Minetest engine](https://www.minetest.net/), install
at least version 5.5.0 to play it.

## Licensing

While the code of the `default` mod was written from scratch it often follows the
original C++ code closely, so out of caution **LGPLv2.1 (or later)** was chosen as license.
Most media files were directly copied from Minetest-c55 0.3.1 which is **CC BY-SA 3.0**.

For details please check the LICENSE.txt files in individual mods.
