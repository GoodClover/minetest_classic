[![ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/sfan5/minetest_classic/shields/downloads/)](https://content.minetest.net/packages/sfan5/minetest_classic/)

This game is a recreation of the classic Minetest-c55 0.3 gameplay, including:

* Original textures
* All four mobs¹
* Identical items, crafting recipes, dig times; closely matched ore distribution

Unlike the original it has (optional) support for:

* Sounds
* PvP
* Localization
* Engine features such as the modern skybox, waving or shadows
* Modern creative inventory and per-player creative mode

To enable some of the modern features check out "Modernize flags" in the settings menu.

This is a game for the [Minetest engine](https://www.minetest.net/), install
at least version 5.5.0 to play it.

**¹**: Fireflies do not spawn naturally and are only available in creative mode.
